# Steel Framework

Currently in progress.

Once this project is completed, it will be a UI pattern library featuring clean, minimal components and vertical rhythm, modular scale, and baseline-aligned text. It will build off of [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) and [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/).

It was made by [Chloe Atchue-Mamlet](http://chloeam.com/) using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
